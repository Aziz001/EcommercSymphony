# Ecommerce Website

## Context 
During my studies at ENSI (National School of Computer Science), we had to develop an Ecommerce Website as a project. We were asked to use these following technologies : Symphony [v.2.8] , Angular JS [v.1.5], Doctorine , MongoDB. 

This project was established by me and 2 other amazing coders. We had 2 months to fully develop the website and to add some extentions, such as the payment bundels. My main work was developing the ShopBundle (Back-end).
